- in this Step we will get all the songs associated with the movie 
- so each movie (or album), in the list of that particular year's movie (or album), in the list is a dict that has it's value as a list of songs from the movie (or album)
- the mechanism is same as extracting movie name in previous step

- so each movie name in the list will become a dictionary storing the songs list as values
