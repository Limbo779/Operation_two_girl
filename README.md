## Hi Recruiters
No, this is definitely not some weird project, nor am I a weird guy. This is just a lost media hunt.

### What this project is about:
- I have used my coding knowledge to search for the obscure tamil song that I listened to on the radio 3 years ago.
- To know more about the song and search, you can check out know_info.md and main plan.md and each phase's plan.md
- I have given the perplexity chat that led here as ideastorm.md
- This is called Operation Two Girl because the lyrics have 'ரெத்தா பொண்ணு' (two girls) throughout the lyrics.
- Even if this fails, at least this method will help other lost media searches.


### How this is structured:
- So in my current search I have 3 phases and one small side quest.
- Each phase has its own plan and structure and will help the next phase.
-If these methods fail, then I should use a different method, but I hope I will find

### Each arc's plan so far:
- **Phase 1**: I have fully scraped [this lyrics' website](https://www.tamil2lyrics.com/) which has around 20,000 tamil songs and yet it still doesn't have my target.
- **Phase 2**: in this phase I will try to collect as much info about radio airing like exact date, time, radio, show name and RJ etc. as this will help the search to narrow down.
- **Phase 3**: use all the info collected so far to make a datahunt for the song
- **Phase 1.5**: This is a small side quest where I tried to find a song based on its 3-second clip. This is where I implemented the current data hunting method which will be used in phase 3.
